<p style={{fontSize:"18px"}}>At Pure Devotion Foundation, privacy for our valued donors is of utmost importance. We strongly believe that the personal information of our donors should not be shared with third parties without prior consent or request from the donor. Privacy is an individual's right, and on our website, donor information such as contact numbers, emails, and addresses is used solely for internal purposes and not for sale. Your contact information is stored in our database and is only used by us to contact you regarding updates on the campaign, upcoming campaigns, announcements, and news. We condemn unauthorized access, misuse, and/or disclosure of customer personal information and have strict guidelines and high-security features to prevent such incidents. Any changes in our 'Privacy Policy' will be posted here on the website.</p>

<h1 style={{fontFamily:"Wallington-Regular"}}>Secure Online Payments</h1>

<p style={{fontSize:"18px"}}>Visitors to our website, please note that your name, email address, and other personal information submitted on our website may be stored with us and may also appear on the website. Similar to other platforms, our server log files receive general information such as the IP address of the visitor, cookies, etc. For financial transactions by credit card, we use a third-party secure payment gateway provided by "PayU," and credit card details are 'not stored' with us. Instead, the information is securely stored and encrypted with Visa/MasterCard.</p>

<h1 style={{fontFamily:"Wallington-Regular"}}>Smart Cookies</h1>

<p style={{fontSize:"18px"}}>We use 'Cookies' to keep track of your current donation session to personalize your experience and allow you to retrieve your donation cart at any time. 'Cookies' are tiny text files that our website places on your computer's hard drive to store information about your donation session and to identify your computer.</p>

<h1 style={{fontFamily:"Wallington-Regular"}}>Shipping and Delivery</h1>

<p style={{fontSize:"18px"}}>It takes one to two weeks for us to ship products to NGOs; the duration varies from campaign to campaign. After donation, we send an email where the delivery time is mentioned.</p>

<h1 style={{fontFamily:"Wallington-Regular"}}>Cancellation and Refund</h1>

<p style={{fontSize:"18px", marginBottom:"100px"}}>Once a donation is made for a particular campaign, it cannot be canceled or refunded. However, you have the option to change the campaign or cause for which you have donated within 12 hours of the donation. After 12 hours, the cause for which the donation is made cannot be changed.</p>
